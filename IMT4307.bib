  Conventional taught learning practices often experience difficulties in keeping students motivated and engaged.
Video games, however, are very successful at sustaining high levels of motivation and engagement through a set of tasks
for hours without apparent loss of focus. In addition, gamers solve complex problems within a gaming environment
without feeling fatigue or frustration, as they would typically do with a comparable learning task. Based on this notion, the
academic community is keen on exploring methods that can deliver deep learner engagement and has shown increased
interest in adopting gamification – the integration of gaming elements, mechanics, and frameworks into non-game
situations and scenarios – as a means to increase student engagement and improve information retention. Its effectiveness
when applied to education has been debatable though, as attempts have generally been restricted to one-dimensional
approaches such as transposing a trivial reward system onto existing teaching materials and/or assessments. Nevertheless,
a gamified, multi-dimensional, problem-based learning approach can yield improved results even when applied to a very
complex and traditionally dry task like the teaching of computer programming, as shown in this paper. The presented
quasi-experimental study used a combination of instructor feedback, real time sequence of scored quizzes, and live coding
to deliver a fully interactive learning experience. More specifically, the “Kahoot!” Classroom Response System (CRS), the
classroom version of the TV game show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?”, and Codecademy’s interactive platform formed
the basis for a learning model which was applied to an entry-level Python programming course. Students were thus
allowed to experience multiple interlocking methods similar to those commonly found in a top quality game experience. To
assess gamification’s impact on learning, empirical data from the gamified group were compared to those from a control
group who was taught through a traditional learning approach, similar to the one which had been used during previous
cohorts. Despite this being a relatively small-scale study, the results and findings for a number of key metrics, including
attendance, downloading of course material, and final grades, were encouraging and proved that the gamified approach
was motivating and enriching for both students and instructors.

  notes = {
  Initial impression: gamifying a entry level python class with kahoot and codeacademy. Seems to be interesting
  
  * Heavy use of buzzwords in intro is kinda eh
  * The rest of the intro sounds fine. 
  * While a lot of these papers talk about motivation and so on contrary to education I feel like the forget that one of the reasons we keep going on in games despite failure is that they dont really have that much consequence. You might lose some progress in a game, but you are free to try again and improve as a player. This is not really something that is applied to a real life context.
  * Badges and points are extrinsic motivators tbh, while there is mention of successful serious games using it, I dont think it impacts the learning outcome in the same way. 
    * It is mentioned to be a means of tracking student progress, which in a way sounds fine though. 
  
  * Mention in related work of a professor who gamified his own class by discarding grading in favour of exp and assignments into quests. Sounds like fun 
  * While I like the idea of turning a 1 hour lecture into three 20 minute components, Kahoot is not a perfect way of assessing knowledge as it rewards quick answering and not only knowing the right answer.
  * Public leaderboard of scores sounds kinda scary
    * In the worst case this would massively demotivate players with bad scores. 
  * "The thinking behind this decision was that rankings tap into people’s natural competitiveness and encourage them to do better, which might motivate students to study more by the desire to improve their position (Natvig et al., 2004)."
    * While sure, competitiveness can improve motivation it can also decrease it. Other studies have shown that cooperation actually can have better effects (Obese Diet serious game from lectures)
    * If you are the bottom of the leaderboards, will that really motivate you to improve?
    
  * What is the reasoning behind going for both kahoot and who wants to be a millionaire?
    * They are both very similar outside of scoring for time as well. 
    
  * I like the more collaborative concept of who wants to be a millionaire over kahoot, but the risk/reward of losing potential points towards your assessment can be a bit scary
    * The guaranteed point tiers are nice though. 
    
  * "These gamification features have been crucial to making Codecademy one of the most popular online education providers with over 24 million users to date (Richard Ruth, 2015) and were the main reason behind selecting it as the delivery platform for the programming exercises."
    * Are points and badges really that crucial though?
    * I personally always felt like the strength of codecademy was more their interactive tutorials instead of their point and achievement system. 
        * At the same time the scoring system is pretty fair here. No risk of losing points or not getting a good amount due to speed of answer. 
        * They tried to motivate students with challenges that had no rewards to see whether winning a challenge itself was enough of a intrinsic motivator. Fair enough, I would not like this decision if it was related to the actual student assessment. 
        
  * "Surprisingly enough, there were mixed opinions on whether game points should be translated into actual marks for module assessments"
    * I dont think that is so surprising given what I've mentioned earlier here. 
    
  * Parts of results could be placed in methods imo. 
  
  * The fact that kahoot worsened over time and that WWTBAM didn't is related to what I discussed earlier. 
    * This could also correlate to the fact that cooperation increases motivation more than competitiveness like the diet game study from the class discussions. 
  },
  
  shortenedSummary = {
   Introduction:
    * Video gamers are constantly kept at high levels of attention compared to standard lectures where your attention span is good for the first 10 min and then diminishes until a break is used to change the environment.
    * No short term wins or instant gratification when confronted with complex learning to keep students motivated. 
    * A promising way to address these counterproductive feelings is to design them with techniques similar to ones found in successful gaming environments.
    * Rather than assume that mobiles, laptops and what not are the cause of attention loss, educators should be open to new possibilities to teach and educate. 
        * Data points out that students who learn with video games have a significant improvement in subject understanding, diligence and motivation
    * dopamine is considered a key role in motivation, effect and learning.
        * Educational techniques that access the same methods could result in learning/reward cycles. 
    * When working with games, we are balancing around the player's skill level instead of a one size fits all lecture. 
        * Allows for less boredom and frustration
        * Better means of providing a state of flow
        
    * Self determination theory should be taken into account when working on gamification. 
        * Relatedness - the need to interact and be connected with others
        * Competence - the need to be effective and master a problem in a given environment
        * Autonomy - the need to control one's life
    * These elements have been shown to affect intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. 
    * Can take individual student fatigue into account to determine the optimal combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. 
    
    * Research questions
        * Are students who use Codecademy and play “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?” and “Kahoot!” more engaged in learning Python programming when compared to peers who engage in traditional class activities?
        * Do students who use Codecademy and play “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?” and “Kahoot!” develop deeper understandings of Python programming when compared to peers engaged in more traditional instruction?
   
   Methods:
    * 12 week university course in introductory python.
        * Gamified using Kahoot, Codeacademy and a modified versions of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
    * 2 consecutive academic years measured
    * Control group of 54 students (43m, 11f)
    * Experimental class of 52 students (44m, 8f)
    * Participants in the age range of 19-25
    * 16 students in the experimental class were regular gamers, 28 played games occasionally and 8 did not play games at all.  
    * The first year was done with the control group
        * low attendance rates, numerous late to class arrivals, lack of interest in reference material outside of exam period. 
    * Students learn more when engaged with the content they are learning. 
    * Attention span decreases after the first 15-20 minutes into a lecture. 
   
   Gamifying the course:
    * Formative assessment with Kahoot
        * initial 1 hour lectures were replaced by 20 minute cycles of micro lecturing, a formative assessment in the form of a Kahoot game, and a brief discussion. 
        * Winner of Kahoot sessions got some candy
        * Visual display of weekly kahoot scores on a public leaderboard
    
    
    * Collaborative problem solving with "Who wants to be a millionaire"?
        * the 1 hour revision seminars were also changed. 
        * Q/A + lectures replaced with WWTBAM
        * For logistics reasons, they split the class randomly into four groups of 13 students (11 male, 2 female) who attended a separate seminar every week for a total of 12 weeks. 
            * Then randomly split into three teams of 4-5 members that remained the same for the rest of the course. 
        * No note taking was allowed by other students while a team was playing. 
        * No official time limit to answer a question, but each game could only last 20 minutes to give all the teams time to play once during the seminar. 
            * 4 multiple choice questions. 
            * Teams had to collaborate, reach a consensus and give a single response. 
        * Three lifelines
            * Poll the class
            * 50/50 - eliminate 2 incorrect answers
            * Ask a friend 
        * After viewing a questions several options are available
            * Refuse to answer, quit the game and retain all points earned to that point
            * Answer the question, potentially earning points or lose all of them if incorrect.
                * To elaborate, 5k and 100k tiers were guaranteed once achieved so if you answered wrong above those tiers you would just drop down to it. 
            * Use a lifeline. 
        
        * Once game was finished they reviewed the answers to all questions with the entire class.  
        * Leading team won chocolate bars at the end of the course for this game component. 
        * The game was also available for download at the end of every week for students who could not attend class. 
        
    * Practicing programming skills with Codeacademy
        * 36 lessons of Codeacademy's python track used for lab excercises. 
        * If students finished early they could get more exercises
        * Students who couldn't finish in time continue working on these at home at their own pace. 
        * In an effort to motivate students further and make them complete exercises as quickly as possible, the lecturers made a number of different challenges
            * To see if winning a challenge without rewards contributed as an intrinsic motivator. 
    
   Results: 
    * Online survey:
        * Students seemed to like it. 
        * Mixed opinions on whether game points should be translated to actual marks for module assessments. 
    * Semi structured interviews:
        * focus groups
            * (No elaboration on how these groups were chosen though.) 
            * (Full list of answer responses not provided.) 
        * extremely positive response(supposedly)
            * (Hard to say whether students chosen for this interview were cherry picked or not though.)
    * EG had higher attendance rate than CG
    * CG group had limited interest in reference material provided on a weekly basis while EG had slightly higher interest,
        * suggesting that they were motivated to study more because they wanted to perform well in the games. 
    * EG had the best overall academic performance. 
        * Average grade of 61\% compared to CG's 53\%
        * Low sample size so no correlation expected between gamification and performance. 
    
   Conclusion:
    * The findings suggest that using a multi-dimensional gamified learning approach has successfully achieved the pedagogical goals outlined in the introduction. 
    * Allows for the opportunity to experience first hand how to make learning fun and addictive
    * Kahoot was good
        * But student engagement decreased over time. Once students started trailing behind in the leaderboard they cared less. 
    * WWTBAM was good
        * Did not suffer like kahoot in terms of engagement. 
    * Codeacademy
        * Some error messages were too vague
        * Not all lessons were a good fit for the curriculum. 
        * ambiguous explanations
        * If a lesson was poor, students struggling with it got the impression that the topic was hard. 
    * Hard to say whether the improvement in engagement is due to short term novelty factors. 
    * Further study needs to be done to assess whether these methods really improve engagement and whether these methods can be applied to other subjects.

  Learning Programming concepts are widely known to be hardest thing with respect to novice learners. Here, we propose learn concepts via serious games together with Linear programmed instruction methodology provides innovative ways to become more engaged in Learning with intrinsic motivation. The Game is based on visualizations of different programming concepts as real life scenarios and on the interpretation of concepts. Intention is to renovate novice to expert in an effortless environment which allows them to practice, make mistakes and learn. Associated review section caused learner to complete levels quicker, providing amplified understanding. The results demonstrate that the students are fascinated towards computer games towards learning of programming concepts. Students responded that, game based learning is motivating, entertaining, concepts in programming can be visualized and learnt owing to game playing and game encourages intrinsic motivation to deeper learning.

  notes = {
    * Another Programming is very hard for beginners! Intro :P
        * Still no sources on the fact that it is challenging!
        * At this point though, do you really need sources when literally everyone says so? :p
            * Would be nice!
        * Sounds like a decent idea to present real world scenarios and make people translate the problem to a programming space.
            * Problem solving and logical thinking as mentioned is not only bound to the real world though: (using game programming as an example, albeit this is a more difficult subject than intro programming)
        * Despite sounding like a good idea, again there seems to be an underestimation of how you actually engage the player. 
            * I get the feeling that they think the player automatically will be engaged. 
        * Solution seems a bit trial and errory
            * There is no focus on what the player does wrong and why, but rather trying to reinforce what they want to teach by taking them through the concept again.
            * It could work, but feedback is very important for the player and better feedback could potentially make them learn faster.
            * They do think of scaling the difficulty down a little bit if the player does not get a high enough score though, which already is an improvement. 
            * They also apparently do give feedback on why your answer is wrong
        * The actual theory basis here is fairly lacking
            * Would have liked more in depth discussion around motivation and constructivism theory. 
        * Their real life metaphores for programming concepts sound fair enough. 
            * Their vocabulary for concepts is wrong though. Their english is not ideal. 
            * You still kinda get what they want to say 
        * Saying an apple is a integer, float or character is a very bad translation of data types to be perfectly honest :P
            * You'd be better off categorizing it into foods, school related things, etc and then translate it to programming later. 
        * Ironically, perebo actually thought about similar things and actually kinda looks a bit better
        * Please actually put some game developers to work on your study instead of taking random pictures from google as your assets :p
            * or at the very least put some effort into it, even if only by a tiny amount. 
        * It started out okay, with some nice ideas, but got progressively worse and worse with every page. I would almost go as far as saying this paper actually was worse than "Perebo Serious Game"

  shortenedSummary = {
    * Introduction
        * Teaching and learning programming is hard for both teachers and learners. Known to be an universal issue
        * Lack of deeper understanding of programming constructs and abstract concepts is the reason for this. 
        * Researchers are thus prompted to explore tools and approaches to decrease the difficulty of both teaching and learning programming. 
        * Learning programming requires the learner to take an association between programming and real world scenarios and translate  from one to the other. 
            * Problem solving and logical thinking develops programming skills. 
            * This strategy is used in the game
                * Each concept is presented in the form of real world scenarios.  
        * Game based learning and gamification mentioned. 
            * type of game play with defined learning outcomes
        * GBL methodology used for this game. 
        * Design and development is described in this paper
        * Focus on finding real life scenarios that are similar to programming concepts. 
        * The main objective is to present it in a way that is understandable even for non computer science students. 
        * Assessment being done through game activities. 
        
    * Related works
        * Other serious games are presented
        * Mentions  that the focus are on students with no pre existing programming knowledge
        
    * Solution approach
        * Basic programming concepts, independent of language. 
        * Real life scenarios that are translatable to programming concepts will be used
        * Each topic will be gamified in this way. 
        * A scenario is given to the player
            * Represents a programming concept indirectly
        * A demonstration of the concept is displayed
        * After this a game activity is presented
        * If the player's score is high enough they can move on. 
            * (Trial and error galore?)
        * Uses programmed learning
            * Based on behaviorist theories of learning
            * probably the easiest structure for a learner to follow
            * everything is cut into small modules. The player moves on a module to module basis. 
            * The player can view the scenarios, learn the concepts and play the related game. 
            * The game component is used to drill and practice the concepts that have been presented. 
            * Failure leads back to the demonstration of the concept before the player can try again. 
            * If the score is not high enough, a simpler illustration is provided. 
    
    * Learning theories
        * conceptual frameworks describing how information is absorbed. 
        * Motivation theory
            * extrinsic and intrinsic motivations
            * Goal is to enrich intrinsic motivation
                * (No mention of how they want to accomplish this so far though)
        * Constructivism theory
            * interacting with the environment and getting experience is what allows you to construct new information. 
    
    * How are the concepts introduced
        * provides examples of real life scenarios that could be tied to programming concepts
        * 3 levels of the system
            * concept introduction
            * learning section where concepts are explained simply
            * a game activity associated with each topic.
        * Game is implemented in Unity  
            * Scripting done both in javascript and c\#
        * "Since, more interesting and engaging games are included as game activity, which makes learner to be more engaged in the game."
            * (The player wont be automatically engaged just because it is a game :p. It actually has to be somewhat good too!)
        * Drag and Drop Game for Data Types
            * example scenario. 
            * needing to buy groceries like apples, milk, sugar as well as pencils and a name board. 
            * The player has to categorize the items
            * Integer bin, float bin, character bin
                * (Sounds awfully familiar lol)
            * When the user clicks an item, it will go to its corresponding bin
                * (To teach the concept I guess)
            * The user can also view a description for why the item goes to which bin. 
            * The game activity is then dropping the right things into the right bin. 
            * The learner can get a description of why their answer is wrong
                * (Well hey, thats nice)
            * "The game will have the Easy Flow to the concepts which is indented to make the concepts better understandable and clearer."
                * (Okay, and what is that?)
            * (Please dont look at the screenshots of the game)
        * Shooting game for variables
            * The player has to shoot variables with wrong variable names
                * (What? What happened to the real life scenarios you talked about earlier?)
                * (There is so much talk about how the games are supposed to show real life scenarios and translate them to programming concepts and they introduce a space shooter!?)
        * More examples
            * (My opinion of this paper already became biased after the previous example :p)
            * (Somehow the visual style is completely different as well now)
        
    * Results and Analysis
        * 20 students participated in the study
            * (No control group I guess?)
        * 2 week period 
            * Both groups got a brief introduction to programming before starting
                * (What? There was no mention of 2 groups)
                * (Okay, I guess they did have a control group then? No mention of its size or anything)
        * one group had standard lectures, other group only used the game.
        * only variables and data types were used for the game in this study
        * at end of second week a set of questions were answered by all students to verify their understanding as well as evaluate how effective the study was. 
        * examples of some open ended questions provided

 Worldwide, the workforce requires professionals to master programming skills, regardless of their
knowledge domain. This demand has led higher education institutions to strengthen their programming
courses, which currently experience high dropout rates and low academic performance. Some institutions
have even faced the need to offer new programming courses for those students whose field is not computer
related, which adds more challenges due to their background. Given this setting, gamification, the use of game
elements in non-game contexts, is put forward as a solution to redesign related courses. Thus, the purpose of
this study was to analyse the impact of gamification, using badges, on learning performance, intrinsic
motivation, self-efficacy and engagement in engineering students taking a basic programming course. It also
analysed the effects of student background variables such as gender, grade point average and previous gaming
experience. One hundred sophomore undergraduates participated in a quasi-experiment, lasting 6 weeks. A
pretest-posttest design with control (N=50) and experimental group (N = 50) was setup. Students carried out
mandatory (e.g. chapter reading quizzes) and optional tasks (completing activities in Code Academy or
Pyschools), and were awarded with badges and meta-badges, through a web based application called Credly.
The university learning management system was used as a platform to inform students of the activities that
would be rewarded with and to keep track of the students’ assignments. Data collection methods included
self-reported questionnaires about intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and personality; and a programming test.
Results show a statistically significant improvement in engagement in gamification students, compared to the
control group. However, no significant impact on learning performance, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and
any of the student background variables was observed. The higher engagement is promising, showing that
gamification might push programming courses. However, further research is needed to understand the lack of
connection between the aforementioned variables.

  using badges for gamification, sounds kinda lackluster, but useful to read anyways potentially to see how bad it can be. 
  
  Their choice of using only badges makes sense as they want to see how viable/unviable it is. I feel like this could be clarified a bit in the introduction though. 
	* Sometimes you wonder if they actually understand gamification as only pointsification components are mentioned as gamification examples. 
	* They seem to think too highly of badges/achievements

	Nice structure and use of scientific methodologies, but feels very dry and too academic. Too little understanding of games. 
	Sometimes you might be engaged in the topic, but busy prioritizing other courses and what not so you cannot do all the optional activities to get a high "engagement" score. 
	
	Points, badges and leaderboards can drive addictive behaviour as it is part of the skinnerbox approach and is primarily a easy surface level implementation.  
	http://biblogg.no/2017/04/18/good-gamification-more-than-just-points/ * Kind of reiterates some of the points about how points/badges/leaderboards are not that useful when only these are used. 
		* Adding desire for creativity and need to experiment to SDT
			* Probably useful to find the sources of this for further discussion. 
  },
  
  shortenedSummary = {
    Introduction:
		* Workforce needs more employees that master programming skills.
		* Problem: high dropout and failing rates on programming courses. 
		* Gamification put forward as alternative solution to enhance programming skills. 
		* Literature is scarce in relation to learning performance (LP)	
			* Points at a mix of gamified elements is preferred, but it is difficult to know which gamified elements are the key to success or failure. 
		* Study has implemented and evaluated a gamification approach, based solely on badges to boost students' LP. 
			* Also considered variables such as intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and engagement.  
		
    Theory:
		* Gamification and digital badges
			* Examples of gamification used is awarding points, leaderboards and badges 
				* (This is not a very good example though. There is more to gamification than just these pointsification things)
			* Badges selected as key gamification element
				* This decision is driven  by a literature review made by Ortiz et all (2016) which mentions that there is a need to study the single impact of gamification design elements, instead of a mixture. 
		
		* Gamification and student variables
			* Few studies on learning performance as focus. 
			* Other research has provided that students in a gamified condition carry out tasks better than the control group, but the mastery of the theoretical knowledge was better in the control group.
				* (Extrinsic motivation in the gamified course maybe?)
			* An increase of intrinsic motivation influences the positive impact of gamification. 
			* SDT and intrinsically motivated behaviours
				* Autonomy
				* Belonging
				* Competence
			* Gamification boosts autonomy by giving the freedom to choose optional activities
			* Competence is pushed by badges, since they give a sense of status recognition
				* (Debateable, a player with less achievements than another can still be at a much higher skill level)
					* (Depends on how many badges are optional or not and yadda yadda)
			* Relatedness is promoted when students share and see each others' accomplishments and awards, such as badges.
				* (Sure, but is this really optimal though? There are people who simply dont care about badges, but are still good at what they do)
			* Intrinsic motivation is highly correlated with learning performance
			* Self efficacy and engagement are also factors when studying the impact of gamification on LP.
				* Self-Efficacy is the belief that a person can carry out specific tasks 
					* (Could be discussed with course theory such as scaffolding and so on.)
			* Summary of dependent and independent variables
				* Learning Performance
				* Intrinsic Motivation
				* Self-Efficacy
				* Engagement
				* (No mention which is dependent or independent.)
			
		* Gamification and background variables
			* other variables affecting the learning process are gender, age, previous gaming experience and personality.
			* Domain specific variables to programming
				* career progress, number of times taking a subject, high school major, career, previous topic experience and General grade point average. 
			
    Research Hypothesis:
		* H1
			* Students involved in a gamified programming course will attain higher intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and engagement as compared to students in a control condition
		* H2
			* Students involved in a gamified course will attain higher learning gains as compared to students in the control condition, considering the changes in mediating variables and the interaction with co-variables. 
	
    Methodology:
		* Sample
			* 132 students from different engineering programs. 
				* Self enrolled into intro programming course which is divided into four parallel sections taught by four different teachers
				* teachers share years of experience and positive students' evaluation grade(what are they trying to say?)
			* Final sample of 100 students
				* Due to factors like absences, illness, dropout, etc
				* 50 experimental, 50 control
				* informed consent was obtained from all students. 
		
		* Research Instruments
			* Students filled in a background survey 
				* age, gender, faculty, career, high school major, digital gaming experience, programming experience, number of times taking the subject. 
			* Grade point averages and curriculum progress gotten from the university.
			* Learning gains measures through 18 item knowledge test
				* two versions designed to avoid students remembering the items. 
			* Subscale of intrinsic motivation inventory adapted to programming context
				* "I would describe this activity as very interesting" replaced with "I would describe programming as very interesting" as example
			* Self-Efficacy: 20 item scale adapting the four problem solving techniques proposed by Polya (2014) to programming context. 
				* understand the problem
				* design a strategy to solve the problem
				* write the program, 
				* verify the program
			* Sample of items used provided in table 2, full version available upon request. 
				* (They seem fair enough)
			* Engagement determined by amount of optional activities carried out and turned in on time through the learning management system. 
				* (As mentioned earlier, you can still be very engaged without taking optional activities)
			* Spanish version of the Big 5 Inventory used to measure personality
			
		* Design of the gamified experience
			* Three course units taking four weeks
			* Credly, web system for awarding and storing digital badges used. 
			* To raise engagement, students were awarded with their first badge for signing up
				* (Seriously? Do they seriously thing that this is engaging?)
			* Each unit presented 5 activities
				* one or two mandatory, the rest optional
				* students could choose three to carry out
				* Finishing 3 activities gives a badge. 
				* If all of these were gotten, a meta badge was acquired
			* Mandatory activities included achieving the highest grade in a reading quiz based on the unit chapter. 
				* (Do you fail if you dont? sentence makes it sound as getting the highest grade is the requirement)
			* Optional activities included finishing excercises in CodeAcademy or Pyschools.
				* Uploading a screen capture to the learning management system was required as evidence (of completion I guess?)
					* (That sounds very easy to tamper with)
			
		* Procedure
			* intervention during 2nd half of the first semester
			* Pre test before intervention where students filled out Big 5, SE, IM and background questionnaires, via google forms. 
			* Knowledge test filled out during class with pen and paper.			
			* Both conditions turned in optional and mandatory assignments during the six weeks of the experiment. 
				* In the gamified condition, students got badges for carrying out assignments successfully compared to the control group. 
			* At the end of the experiment, students filled out the SE and IM instruments for a 2nd time and a post test in class during the last lesson. 
		
		* Data analysis
			* SPSS v20 used
			* Significance level of p<.05 used
			* descriptive statistics calculated to get overview of research variable values
			* preliminary analysis discarded co-variables as none were significantly related to learning gains.
			* Analysis of variance and covariance carried out
			* Bonferroni correction applied
			* Effect size interpretation based on Baguley (2009)
				* Small effect size (from d=0.2), medium (from d=0.5) and large (from d=0.8)
			
    Results:
		* Significantly difference for gamified condition in terms of engagement. 
			* Average of 8 activities over 5 in the control group with 10 total. 
		* No significant impact on learning performance
		
    Discussion: 
		* the fact that engagement increases with gamification is expected
		* lack of studies focusing exclusively on badges and their effects on engagement
		* students might have gotten exhausted from filling in research instruments
		* SE usually is high at the start of a course, but as more demanding tasks are being put forward, it lessens.
			* more demanding tasks already present due to experiment in 2nd half of semester

  Using games in educational contexts is an old concept that got a renaissance in the 1980s when
Thomas Malone did an analysis of computer games and why they are fun and motivating. Later
Malone discussed his findings with similar results extracted from studies by Mark Lepper in a merger
that resulted in the Taxonomy of intrinsic motivation. How well designed digital games can support
intrinsic motivation has often been discussed in research during the last decades, but less has been
written on course design that stimulates learning for learning’s sake. In today’s blended learning with
an increased part of distance education there are several reasons to build courses on mechanisms
that strive for more than just having students to answer multiple choice questions. The aim of this
study is to explore how the various parts in the Taxonomy of intrinsic motivation might be used in
course development to design blended learning and online courses that motivate students without the
traditional carrots and sticks. This case study is based on a course in Games Based Learning (GBL)
where students build their own learning games based on presented and discussed GBL theories.
Data has been gathered from group discussions with students at examination seminars, evaluation
questionnaires, and online discussion fora in the virtual course platform. Findings show that the basic
components from the Taxonomy of intrinsic motivation have a potential to stimulate students both on
the level of internal motivation and on the level of interpersonal motivation. Ideas and theories for
learner motivation might also be presented to the students to stimulate the design of the game
prototypes. However, if a course built on the concept of intrinsic motivation is given simultaneously as
a course with sticks and carrots as prime motivational ingredients, the extrinsic motivation design in
the latter course will override the intrinsic motivation.

  How to develop courses with intrinsic motivation in mind for game based learning.
  
  Can compare Malone's model to other ones like SDT. 
  * I would disagree that challenge is necessary for motivation.
    * Look at easier Nintendo games
    * Are games like the Walking Dead challenging?
    * Games that are more like cinematic experiences can still motivate the player to play. 
  
  * Fantasy sounds fair enough
  * I personally find the approach of making your own games more valuable than playing a serious game that teaches you how to make a game. 
    * Not like I've tried a serious game that teaches me how to make games. It could be fun as well, but I feel like in that case a mixture of both would be preferred. Theory without application is kinda useless. 

  * A LOT of recurring citations to (Kapp, 2012). 
    * Too many?
    
  * Good amount of theory, but is it too much compared to the rest of the content?
    * 50\% theory
    * I would have preferred deeper discussions around how the course was built upon the taxonomy instead of short single paragraphs on each. 
    * Methods/results in general is lacking as it is a bit too high level(and short) to truly deliver the details of how the theory has been applied to the course. 
    * Regardless, an interesting read. 
    * I dont think the taxonomy presented should be used as a checklist, but rather as a means to think about the various aspects that can promote intrinsic motivation
        * To prevent adding things in just for the sake of checking off a box. Better to be more considerate and make meaningful choices to how the course is structured. 
    * That extrinsic motivations can interfere with intrinsic ones is a problem. 

  * Grammar feels a bit off in this paper.

  shortenedSummary = {
    Introduction:
        * Involving games and game mechanics in education has been practiced since Chess and Kalah/Mancala
        * The three key elements in Malone's model named "The theory of intrinsically motivating instruction" are challenge, fantasy and curiosity (Malone, 1981)
        * (Challenge) To make a game challenging the game goals should have uncertain outcomes and if the goals are too obvious and easy to achieve, the player will not be motivated. 
            * Identified game mechanics for making the goals uncertain are various difficulty levels, multiple level goals, randomness and hidden information.
            * Goals should also be personally meaningful and stimulate the player's self esteem
            * Having a broad range of challenges divided into difficulty levels is a way to stimulate intrinsic motivation. 
        * (Fantasy)
            * A fantasy inducing game is one that "evokes mental images of things not present to the senses or within the actual experience of the person involved"
            * Extrinsic Fantasies
                * depend on the use of skills and not on the fantasy itself.
            * Intrinsic fantasies
                * Malone sees these as more interesting and instructional
                * Also depends on skills, but that the skills at the same time are depending on the fantasy. 
                * Cognitive advantage: evoked images or metaphors often help the learner to apply earlier knowledge in the process of learning new things. 
        * (Curiosity)
            * Environments providing an optimal level of informational complexity have the potential to stimulate curiosity. 
            * Flow Theory is related. 
            * Sensory curiosity
                * evoked by multimedia effects
            * Cognitive curiosity
                * evoked by learning structures that the learners could elaborate themselves
        
        * Mark Lepper used Malone's idea to create the "Taxonomy of Intrinsic Motivation"
        * Little has been written about how the recognized key factors that supports intrinsic motivation could be implemented in course content and course activities. 
        * Study aims to explore and discuss the how the various parts of the Taxonomy of Intrinsic Motivation might be used in course development to design blended learning that might motivate students without the traditional use of carrots and sticks.  
        
    Background
        * There is still no model for integrating educational theory and game design
        * Some researchers have looked at how the Flow theory might be combined with learning theory in computer games. 
        * The use of Game Based Learning in education has increased, but with a risk for negative consequences when stereotypical gamification is implemented without alignment towards learning outcomes. 
        * At least 2 approaches for GBL
            * Based on the idea that students learn to program by constructing their own digital games. 
                * By making their own games they will at the same time learn useful programming techniques and GBL theory.
            * In the other approach, students learn by playing games that can be Commercial off the Shelf(COTS) games, educational games or serious games. 
                * COTS are not explicitly aligned to any learning outcomes while educational games are created for learning though. 
        * Common criticism of serious games is that they tend to be too serious and not particularly motivational. 
            * You want to avoid taking the bad features of both worlds(education and entertainment).
        
        * Extrinsic motivations
            * activities where students can achieve rewards and try to avoid punishment. 
            * Sticks and carrots are not related to the activity itself
                * Grades, credits, certificates, prizes, diplomas
            * Mechanisms for extrinsic motivation are often combined with the intrinsic motivation design that is described later, but there are studies that shows that children that achieve extrinsic rewards show less interest in the activity in the long run. 
                * In general, sticks and carrots seems to make children complete tasks faster, but extrinsic incentives may undermine their intrinsic motivation. 
            
        * Intrinsic motivations
            * Gaming for gaming's sake or learning for the sake of learning. 
            * Students that are intrinsically motivated tend to be more aware of complexities, inconsistencies and unexpected possibilities. 
                * They may spend more time and effort learning something and also that they feel better about what they learnt afterwards with a tendency to use the knowledge in the future. 
        
        * The taxonomy of intrinsic motivation
            * Internal motivation
                * Challenge in terms of goals, uncertain outcomes and performance feedback
                * Curiosity in terms of sensory and cognitive inquisitiveness
                * Control in terms of contingency, choice and power
                * Fantasy with emotional and cognitive aspects interwoven
            * Interpersonal motivation
                * Cooperation in terms of players working together to achieve goals
                * Competition where players compete against each other to achieve goals
                * Recognition in terms of making achievements available for others. 
        
        * Case study and methods for data collection
            * case study based on a course in GBL where the author is the subject matter expert, the instructional designer as well as the course developer. 
            * 50ish students taking the course, following programmes in Game construction and Digital media.
            * Mandatory for digital media and elective for game construction. 
            * 10 lectures, 5 assignments and a project which is a mix of theory and practical work. 
                * Some assignments are about making games while others are discussing theoretical short essays
                * Guest lecturers selected to give a broad perspective on GBL and Gamification (More info on selection process preferred?)
                * HTML5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and game creation techniques are part of the game creation assignments. 
            * Data gathered from course evaluation questionnaires and discussions with students and teachers. 
                * (No source of questionnaire questions or answers)
        
        * Findings and discussions
            * Use of internal motivation in the GBL course
                * (Challenge) 
                    * has been implemented with clear learning objectives as goals, complex grading criteria as uncertain outcomes and iterative feedback or feed-forward during the course and examination seminars at the end of the course. 
                * (Curiosity) 
                    * is supported by a mix of the Malonian sensory concept of involving multimedia and stimulating cognitive inquisitiveness by assignments and discussions on contemporary research.  
                * (Control) 
                    * has not been a main focus, but facilitation sessions face to face and online in combination with differentiated grading criteria for making students more confident. Open choices for group formation and project design to give students freedom. 
                * (Fantasy) 
                    * in the emotional aspect brought up in assignments and discussions on course participants' earlier gaming experiences and favourite games. The cognitive fantasy aspects are interwoven with similar activities where participants discuss what they have learnt from playing games and how this can be applied to new contexts. 
            * Use of interpersonal motivation in the GBL course
                * (Cooperation)
                    * integrated with the possibility to work in groups with assignment and projects except for assignments where the students should describe their earlier gaming experiences or create their personal e-Portfolio. Students always had the choice of working alone as well. 
                * (Competition)
                    * Not strongly emphasized. Mostly because it might not be fruitful to put extra pressure on students from digital media when it comes to programming as they have less pre-knowledge. 
                    * All competitions are voluntary and the rewards are mainly the possibility of showing off yourself and your work. 
                    * The best learning game prototypes can be extended for participation in an international competition for learning games in Germany. 
                * (Recognition)
                    * learning game prototypes should be presented in a multimodal mix. 
                    * Games are demonstrated live on examination seminars as well as in submitted demonstration videos
                    * Description of the workflow and how the game design is aligned to the learning theory is presented in the students' own e-Portfolios
                * Mix of extrinsic/intrinsic motivators
                    * grading is a carrot
                    * more of a focus on intrinsic over extrinsic motivators in this course
                        * (How?)
                    * Students liked the open and free assignments in the GBL course and found them more stimulating and exciting despite prioritizing other courses due to their more standard means of examination. 
        
        * Conclusions
            * As Malone suggests, models for intrinsic motivation could be used as checklists in the design of instructional environments. 
                * (I feel like you should think more about it than just use it as a checklist and shoehorn in content)
            * If a course focused around intrinsic motivation runs in parallel with another course that has extrinsic rewards and surveillance, then the latter course seems to block the more open ended activities in the former.  
                * Tasks with extrinsic motivators tend to get the priority. 
                * Yet the tasks with a more intrinsic focus are those which the students want to elaborate on later after the course was finished.

  Using digital games for educational purposes has been associated with higher levels of motivation
among learners of different educational levels. However, the underlying psychological factors involved
in digital game based learning (DGBL) have been rarely analyzed considering the self-determination
theory (SDT, Ryan & Deci, 2000b); the relation of SDT with the flow experience (Csikszentmihalyi,
1990) has neither been evaluated in the context of DGBL. Evaluating DGBL under the perspective of
SDT can improve the study of motivational factors in DGBL. In this paper, we aim to introduce the
LMGM-SDT theoretical framework, where the use of DGBL is analyzed through the Learning
Mechanics and Game Mechanics mapping model (LM-GM, Arnab et al., 2015) and its relation with the
components of the SDT. The implications for the use of DGBL in order to promote learners’ motivation
are also discussed.

  Programming environments and game environments
share many of the same characteristics, such as requiring their
users to understand strategies and solve difficult challenges. Yet,
only game designers have been able to capitalize on methods
that are consistently able to keep their users engaged. Consequently,
software engineers have been increasingly interested in
understanding how these game experiences can be transferred to
programming experiences, a process termed gamification.
In this perspective paper, we offer a formal argument that
gamification as applied today is predominately narrow, placing
emphasis on the reward aspects of game mechanics at the
expense of other important game elements, such as framing. We
argue that more authentic game experiences are possible when
programming environments are re-conceptualized and assessed
as holistic, serious games. This broad gamification enables us
to more effectively apply and leverage the breadth of game
elements to the construction and understanding of programming
environments.

Students occasionally find it difficult to learn new programming languages. Previous work showed that students have experienced ineffective learning, lack of interest towards this course and lack of motivation. The rationale for this is that in previous studies, some researchers have mentioned the use of game elements but none have mentioned a gamification framework that integrates the requirements for learning programming language subjects. Therefore, this study proposed gamification framework that consists of game elements and programming learning requirements. This framework is verified by lecturers and students. The findings shown, the mean score of each combination of programming learning requirements and game elements is more than 4.00.

    * This intro is all over the place talking about the related work and not really enough about the context you would expect in such a section. 
    * Kind of hard to read, language is cumbersome. 
        * It almost gets worse and worse the deeper you go :p
        * Pretty broken english
    * Actually, it is so unreadable that an analysis is impossible. Will probably scrap this paper.

    Introduction
        * Some researchers use gamification frameworks like Game Based Learning (GBL)
        * UniGame is one such framework which is designed to apply GBL within the classroom.
            * has been applied to higher education 
            * one objective of this framework is the possibility of using different educational games within different subjects, with a focus on social games, virtual communities and collaborative learning. 
            * games can be used in online or regular classes. 
        * *Mentions other frameworks as well*
        * This research tries to solve the problem(motivation I guess?) through a Gamification approach to verify the effectiveness of applying a gamification approach to students in difficult subjects like programming(here we go again)
        * In conclusion (??), some researchers have mentioned the use of game elements, but nobody have mentioned a gamification framework that integrates the requirements for learning programming language subjects. 
            * "Therefore, the details of gamification frameworks's construction are presented in the following section" (Next section is Related Work :P)

    Gamification-based learning framework
        * (Goal seems to be that they want to increase student motivation and to increase their interest in learning programming)
        * In order to increase student motivation the study suggests implementing game rules such as: badges, leaderboards, top 10 and points/stars. 
        "Using game rules in learning means that when students engage in activities during class or learning application such as answering questions or completing a particular task, teachers or system would award them with Badges, Points or Stars"
        * "These activities could motivate students to continuously doing well in order to get rewarded"
            * (And what of the students that dont to well?)
            * (What of the students that dont care about badges and leaderboards?)
        * Learning material should not be outdated like it already is in many Universities. 
        * Multiple choice and drag and drop questions would help the students answer with a single click.

  abstract = {
  In this paper, an inquiry‐based ubiquitous gaming approach was proposed. The objective of the study was to enhance students’ performances in in‐field learning activities. To show the advantages of the approach, an experiment was carried out to assess the effects of it on students’ learning achievement, motivation, critical thinking, and problem solving. Furthermore, the students’ behavioral patterns were investigated via content and sequential analysis methods. The experimental outcomes show that the approach promoted students’ performances of learning achievement and intrinsic motivation; moreover, the students’ perceptions of their problem solving and critical thinking were significantly promoted as well. The learning behavior analysis further show that the designated approach stimulated the participants to actively engage in field observation, comparison, and data searching in the context ware in‐field learning activity.
