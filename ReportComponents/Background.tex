\section{Background}
* Background for serious games and gamification
* General goal in relation to education is to increase the motivation of students to a similar degree that games do when being played. 
* Thus there is an attempt to take elements from games in order to create experiences that hopefully increase the motivation of students as motivation, particularly of the intrinsic variety generally is correlated with better learning outcomes~\cite{ryan2000intrinsic}. 

* Related motivational theories
    * Self-Determination Theory~\cite{ryan2000intrinsic}
    * Malone's motivational model~\cite{malone1981toward}
    * Taxonomy of Intrinsic motivation~\cite{maloneTax}
