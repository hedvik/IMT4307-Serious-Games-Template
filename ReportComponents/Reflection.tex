\section{Reflection on Learning}
The serious games course has taught me a fair share of things throughout the semester, both in relation to course content and research. 

The course itself has brought the sheer variety of topics that serious games are used for to light. While gamification and serious games are used for many good purposes, the course has also highlighted that there are more manipulative and worrisome examples through propaganda games and games for work. I have also gotten an introduction to various theory in relation to motivation and learning that are employed when developing serious games and gamification which was useful for the actual research itself. 

I originally had the impression that written academic research was held to a very high standard. By going through the course as well as doing research on gamification I have learned that this really is not the case. While there are great research papers out there, there is also a large amount of badly written research with large holes and illogical reasoning. This has made me quite a bit more appreciative when finding research papers that actually are well written as they can be hard to find. Thanks to this, I feel like I have learned to become far more critical of academic papers and be able to look for potential errors in the ideas and reasoning in a better way than before. 

Furthermore, I have also learned that the term ''gamification'' has kind of lost its original meaning as the large amount of shallow and pointsified implementations provide the wrong impression of what the term originally was supposed to mean. Similar to how I have become more appreciative of well written academic papers, I have also become more appreciative of the gamifications and serious games that actually manage to fulfill their purpose to a decent degree. 

Finally, as part of making this report I have gained some experience in writing my first non-trivially sized literature review. This is definitely a very useful experience to have for the next year when I have to actually write the master thesis.
