\section{Methods}
\subsection{Analysis Framework of Papers}    
Since game mechanics are applied at various depths in gamification it is necessary to first make a distinction between what we consider as ''shallow'' and ''deep'' gamification. 

\subsubsection{Pointsification}\label{sec:pointsification}
To start off, we should define what shallow gamification is before moving deeper. A starting point would be ''Pointsification''~\cite{robertson2010} which is a term coined by Margaret Robertson. Pointsification primarily consists of using game elements like points, leaderboards and badges/achievements as a tool to motivate players into performing tasks. While there is nothing that is necessarily wrong with using these elements, it could be seen as a quick and simple means to add game elements to the gamified activity. These game elements are relatively universal and can be found in most games, but at the same time, they are not essential components that make a good game interesting and fun to play. As such, pointsification elements could be seen as ''surface level'' components of games. Points, badges and leaderboards can be used to augment the main activity by providing feedback on performance and progress, but do not necessarily make the main activity any more or less fun than it already is. It is important to consider that games are an experience which is the result of many various mechanics that are mixed together in different ways. The reductionist approach of simply taking some elements out of a game and applying them elsewhere might not give the same effect as they become more isolated and may lose their synergy with other mechanics. 

Furthermore, using pointsification as a sort of checklist to gamify an activity means that less thought is put into how these mechanics actually support the learning outcomes of the activity. Leaderboards as a game mechanic could for example support the learning outcomes of an activity if the goal was to teach the player about competition, but for most topics, it simply ends up as a potential motivator for players that like competition. It may motivate some players to learn more, but also demotivate others.


\subsubsection{Player types}
An important consideration when gamifying an activity is that the use of game elements should complement the target player demographic. An example of shallow gamification would be to ignore this. To get an approximation of the different types of players we could look at the BrainHex~\cite{nacke2014brainhex} paper and their defined player types. It might not be a perfect approximation of player types as the questionnaire used is relatively short and simple, but should provide some insight into what different types of players like and dislike. On the BrainHex website there is also a section on BrainHex Exceptions~\cite{brainhexexceptions} which are aspects of games that players dislike and their respective opposite classes. 

Two of these exceptions are the ''No Punishment''(Opposite of the Conqueror class) and the ''No Pressure''(Opposite of the Daredevil class) which could be relevant in relation to how player types react to pointsification. The ''No Punishment'' exception means that the player dislikes repetition of the same task which is a component of leaderboards. The ''No Pressure'' exception dislikes performing under pressure and time-limited tasks which can be problematic for time-based scoring systems and leaderboards. This means that if pointsification elements are used, they should be used in a demographic which consists of primarily Conquerors and Daredevils. In general though, it would be beneficial to consider that there may be players that can be demotivated by certain aspects of the gamification and provide alternatives if possible. 

\if{false}
While there is no data on the distribution of BrainHex exceptions, we can look at the distribution of classes where Conquerors and Daredevils are either primary or secondary class. 
            * 49.7\% of this sample includes Conqueror as either primary or secondary class.  
            * 14.9\% of this sample includes Daredevil as either primary or secondary class. 
            * While a sizable amount of their sample is Conquerors which may favour these pointsification mechanics, there is still a majority where the preference is unknown as the exceptions are independent of player types outside of their opposite. 
        * Regardless, there isn't any major conclusions to be drawn here as the game industry and market has changed a fair amount since 2010.
    * Some players can benefit from competition and leaderboard like gamification, others might become demotivated because they cannot do well or do not like to share their performance publicly. 
    * TLDR: Does the use of gamification support the player types that may be present in your demographic?

\subsubsection{Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation}
Another important aspect of gamification that needs to be considered for the analysis is how the games or gamified environments make use of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. Since the analysis topic is related to education, extrinsic motivators may include additional credits, points towards grades and other benefits that are not directly related to the activity of learning. It is beneficial to look at how the analysed papers attempt to foster intrinsic motivation through the game/gamified activity and discuss the effectiveness of the attempt. A serious game that means to teach the player about certain topics may have thought about intrinsic motivation, but if the game simply is not fun to play then there are limits to how engaged the player can be. 


\subsubsection{The relationship towards failure}\label{sec:failure}
An aspect of deeper gamification I would like to highlight is the relationship towards failure. This is primarily relevant towards gamification of education, but still a useful topic to mention regardless. Games generally allow the player to keep attempting as many times as they want until they are satisfied with their performance. There is often some punishment for failure, but the player is usually able to retry in order to overcome the challenge they face. This is contrary to how the real world works as students are required to perform well to get their grades, but unable to properly retry as many times as they want to improve. This lowered consequence of failure we see in games compared to the real world is useful to consider when gamifying education as it encourages the students to retry and improve if they are unsatisfied with their results. 
This opens up for a more trial and error type approach that potentially could lead to more knowledge transfer if the player is dedicated to improve. This approach is a central component of challenging games like \emph{Dark Souls} and \emph{Super Meat Boy} as it allows the player to hone their skills through repetition and experimentation until they overcome the challenge they face. However, the effectiveness of trial and error may diminish severely if the game is too simple. For example, if trial and error is allowed in a simple quiz game, then the player might simply get the correct answer from using brute force which could result in limited to zero knowledge gain.


\subsubsection{Shallow And Deep Gamification}
We can thus define traits of shallow gamification in this way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ''Surface level'' elements like points, badges and leaderboards are used without any other mechanics to synergise with.
    \item Little thought is put into how the game elements in the gamified activity support the learning outcomes. 
    \item The use of game elements does not support the player types present in the demographic of the gamified activity.
    \item Motivation is primarily fostered through extrinsic means. 
    \item Supporting failure is not considered in any way. 
\end{itemize}

As the contrast to shallow gamification, we can define traits of deep gamification as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Going deeper than just using the ''surface level'' pointsification elements. Pointsification elements can be present, but they should be used in conjunction with other mechanics as well. 
    \item Thought is put into how the game elements in the gamified activity support the learning outcomes.
    \item The use of game elements supports the player types present in the demographic of the gamified activity.
    \item There are attempts at making sure that the player is intrinsically motivated to play and learn with the game or gamified activity. 
    \item The gamified environment supports failure and allows the player to improve by retrying and optimising their performance. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Other Quality Assessment Criteria}
While the previous section described the analysis framework for making the distinction between shallow and deep gamification, this section goes through additional quality assessment criteria that will be used in the literature review. These criteria are based on what we used when assessing papers for the presentations in the serious games course with some additions. 

\subsubsection{Semantic Criteria}
The first list that consists of semantic criteria is as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the idea sound? Does it make sense?
    \item Does the paper contribute to the field of research?
    \item Do the results presented justify the conclusions of the paper?
    \item Does the solution justify the use of game elements?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Research Criteria}
The final list of criteria is related to the quality of the research. This includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are the drawn conclusions supported by the sample size?
    \item Does the study make use of control groups when measuring effects?
    \item What are the sample methods used? How does it affect the results?
    \item What research instruments were used for data collection?
    \item Does the paper attempt to identify variables that may affect the results?
    \item Are the results repeatable? If not, what has been left out?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Literature Acquisition For The Review}
Acquiring literature for the review was primarily handled through the use of Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. There was no direct distinction between serious games and gamification for this search as a serious game for education could be considered as a gamification of learning. 

\subsubsection{Google Scholar}
Google Scholar was initially searched through using the search term: ''\textbf{\emph{"serious games" "education" "programming" "intrinsic" "extrinsic" "motivation" OR "motivators"}}''. The results were filtered for literature that was published after 2014 and the first three result pages were scanned through for relevant papers. Papers were chosen based on the following criteria: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item As long it was not a survey/literature review as the focus is on papers that present their own gamification approaches.  
    \item As long as keywords in either the title or abstract included ''programming'' and intrinsic or extrinsic motivations. 
    \item As long as the paper was related to serious games and gamification for education. 
\end{itemize}

From this search, 4 papers were found which satisfied all the mentioned criterias. 

\subsubsection{IEEE Xplore}
IEEE Xplore was also searched through using the same search term as with Google Scholar. This search only provided 14 results so the entire results list was scanned through with the same criterias as used for Google Scholar. 

From this search, 1 paper was found which satisfied the criterias. 

\subsubsection{Final Results} 
From the 5 papers found, 1 was removed due to being written too poorly to be in a state for analysis. The grammatical state of this paper was unreadable to a point where understanding the intent was impossible. This means that the final sample of literature consisted of 4 papers.
