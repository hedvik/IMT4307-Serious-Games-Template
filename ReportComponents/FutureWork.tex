\section{Future Work}
If this area of research were to be continued it would have been nice to potentially extend the shallow/deep gamification framework even further and put a larger focus on these and not a combination of gamification quality and paper quality. While I think both are important, going even deeper into the gamification component could have some benefits. Going for a slightly lighter framework would make it easier to review more papers within the same space of time and potentially gain more insight into various depths of gamification on a larger scale.  

If the framework ended up comprehensive enough on the topic of gamification depth, it could also be used as a set of guidelines in relation to what a developer could think when developing a education-focused gamification or serious game. This could make them aware of what their design decisions may result in and hopefully end up with a better designed and thought through experience. This could also be useful for developers seeking to create and iterate upon deeper gamification experiences. The reason for this is that they would be provided with a set of criteria that could be considered when developing the solution and give an idea of common pitfalls that result in shallow gamification.
